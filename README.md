# üß© springboot-websocket-chat

A real-time chat application built with Spring Boot and WebSocket, designed for scalable, containerized deployment on AWS ECS (Fargate) using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Spring Boot WebSocket** application configured for real-time communication and optimized for deployment via AWS ECS + CI/CD (ECR + Fargate). The goal is a low-maintenance, scalable system with a production-ready pipeline and ALB (Application Load Balancer) WebSocket support.
